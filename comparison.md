Comparison of App Fair with other app distribution networks
===========================================================

# F-Droid

[F-Droid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid) is an app store and software repository for Android, serving a similar function to the Google Play store. The main repository, hosted by the project, contains only free and open source apps. Applications can be browsed, downloaded and installed from the F-Droid website or client app without the need to register for an account. "Anti-Features" such as advertising, user tracking, or dependence on non-free software are flagged in app descriptions.

The following table attempts to summarize some of the similarities and differences between the App Fair and F-Droid.
