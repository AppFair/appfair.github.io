# Welcome to the App Fair

The App Fair is an independent app distribution platform for open-source & native applications written in Swift. 

Your fork of the [appfair/App](https://github.com/appfair/App) repository will be automatically built and distributed as one of the [appfair/App releases](https://github.com/appfair/App/releases). 

These releases can be browsed, searched, and installed using the macOS [App-Fair/App](https://github.com/App-Fair/App), which acts as the hub for discovering, researching, installing, and updating apps.

Note that these releases are automatically signed with an "ad-hoc" certificate, so you, the developer, do not need to subscribe to any paid membership programs.
